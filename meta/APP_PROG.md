# MyDayHub — Development Progress Summary
Updated: 2025-08-10
Order: chronological (newest at the bottom)

## Snapshot (current)
- Board loads via API (`getAll`).  
- Creating a task persists via `createTask`, re-sorts column, updates counter.  
- Sorting rules: incomplete first (priority before normal); completed at bottom.  
- Counters stay in sync after add and drag-and-drop.  
- Visual-only for move/priority/complete/delete/duplicate (persistence pending).

## 2025-08-04 00:00 — Environment & Mobile UX
**Focus**  
Stabilize local dev and improve mobile experience.

**Key work**  
- Fixed local server and CSS issues (z-index, alignment).  
- Mobile header with hamburger menu.  
- Columns stack vertically on small screens.  
- Added Move Mode (touch), unified edit modal, quick actions, and meta icons.

**Status**  
UI flows working across desktop/mobile.

**Next steps**  
- Style meta indicators as subtle badges.  
- Add editor auto-save and "Last saved" footer.  
- Create `/api/tasks.php` PUT route for saving task details.

---

## 2025-08-04 23:00 — Unified Note Editor (foundation)
**Focus**  
Replace simple modal with a reusable editor.

**Key work**  
- New HTML in `index.php` for Unified Editor shell.  
- New stylesheet `/assets/css/views/editor.css`.  
- New module `/assets/js/editor.js` (open/close, maximize, tabs).  
- Connected task Edit to `UnifiedEditor.open()`.

**Status**  
Editor foundation complete and decoupled from tasks.js.

**Next steps**  
Make the ribbon responsive (overflow-to-menu pattern).

---

## 2025-08-08 08:00 — Task Card Icons (SVG)
**Focus**  
Replace emojis with crisp SVG icons and finalize menu.

**Key work**  
- Clean SVG set styled via `currentColor`.  
- Moved menu CSS into `/assets/css/views/tasks.css`.  
- Iterated stroke-width and symbols for clarity.

**Status**  
Final icons shipped; default color tuned for theme.

**Next steps**  
Resume editor ribbon responsiveness work.

---

## 2025-08-08 10:00 — Unified Editor Polish
**Focus**  
Stabilize and add essential tools.

**Key work**  
- Fixed header layout and status bar.  
- Maximize/restore logic and icons.  
- Monospace textarea for alignment.  
- Simplified ribbon (removed ResizeObserver overflow logic).  
- Implemented case transforms, underline, block frame, calculator, font size.  
- Live word/char/line counts.

**Status**  
Editor stable and meets current usability goals.

**Next steps**  
Move on to backend integration.

---

## 2025-08-08 16:00 — Backend Architecture (pivot)
**Focus**  
Build durable persistence and a clean API.

**Key work**  
- Designed v4 schema (users with JSON preferences, columns, tasks with ENUM
  status, dense positions).  
- Created single-pipe API gateway `/api/api.php`.  
- Added `/api/modules/` for feature handlers (e.g., tasks.handler.php).  

**Status**  
DB and gateway staged; `getAll` ready.  
Frontend still using in-browser data at this point.

**Next steps**  
Wire tasks.js to the API for live board data.

---

## 2025-08-08 22:00 — Backend Debugging & Logging
**Focus**  
Unblock API JSON failures and make errors observable.

**Key work**  
- Replaced frontend dev data with `fetch` to gateway, exposing backend errors.  
- Custom error handler in `/includes/config.php` with `DEVMODE=true` writes
  to `/debug.log`.  
- Fixed server file permissions for log creation.  
- Verified DB connectivity with a standalone test script.  

**Status**  
Env and DB confirmed; remaining fault isolated to app code paths.

**Next steps**  
Inspect/repair core gateway-handler flow; proceed to data load in UI.

---

## 2025-08-10 18:00 — Tasks: Persistence + UX Stability
**Focus**  
Persist creation; stabilize sorting, counts, and effects.

**Key work**  
- Implemented `createTask` in tasks handler; returns normalized task payload.  
- Hooked "+ New Task" footer → API; render response; re-sort; update counter.  
- Fixed add-form blur/submit race (idempotent restore).  
- Moved completion handling to `change` event so sorting always runs.  
- Counters update for both source and destination after drag-and-drop.  
- Clipped completion flare to the card (`overflow:hidden`, non-interactive
  `::after`).

**Status**  
Create + load are persisted. Sorting and counters are consistent.

**Next steps**  
1) Persist `toggleComplete` and `togglePriority`.  
2) Persist `moveTask` with position compaction.  
3) Persist `deleteTask` and `duplicateTask`.  
4) Centralize fetch/error UX and consider ETag or `updated_at`.  
5) Inline title edit, keyboard flows, and helpful empty states.

---

## Testing Notes
- Verified `getAll` via curl and in UI (Weekdays/Chores sample).  
- Confirmed `createTask` persists, sorts correctly, and updates counters.  
- Counters stay accurate after drag-and-drop and after add.  
- Completion flash stays inside the task card.

---
## 2025-08-10 22:15 — Session Summary & Next Steps
**Focus**
Consolidate progress and set the next implementation path.

**Key work**
- Stabilized end-to-end flow for load, create, and cross-column move.
- Normalized client sorting triggers (render, DnD, completion change).
- Updated spec to 4.2.0 Beta; documented CSRF protection and QA criteria.
- Confirmed curl tests for createTask, moveTask, and getAll.

**Status**
Core board interactions are persisted and reliable. Remaining mutations are
documented and scheduled.

**Next steps (priority order)**

1) Status persistence
   toggleComplete(task_id, completed) and togglePriority(task_id, on);
   update status, return normalized task, and re-sort on response.
2) In-column reordering
3) Extend moveTask with to_position or before_task_id; transactional
   updates; dense positions after write.
4) Delete and duplicate
  deleteTask (remove + compact) and duplicateTask (insert at end).
5) CSRF enablement in code
   Generate token per session; emit <meta name="csrf">; validate
   X-CSRF-Token for all writes; set cookie flags (HttpOnly,
   SameSite=Lax, Secure in prod).
6) Error UX
7) Replace alerts with a small toast; standardize error envelope and logging.
