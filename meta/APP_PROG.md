### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/8/25, 10 PM)

This session was a deep dive into backend debugging to resolve a persistent, critical
application failure. Our initial goal to connect the frontend to the backend API
was blocked by a fatal PHP error that prevented valid JSON from being returned.
The session evolved into a systematic process of elimination to find the root cause.

### Key Accomplishments
* **Live Data Connection Attempt:** We replaced the frontend dev data in `tasks.js`
	with a `fetch` call to the new API gateway, which revealed the backend issue.
* **Robust Error Logging Implemented:** To diagnose the silent PHP error, we
	implemented a proper debugging infrastructure.
	* We created a custom error handler in `/includes/config.php` that, when
		`DEVMODE` is true, intercepts all PHP errors and writes them to a
		`/debug.log` file in the project root.
* **Environment Debugging:** We diagnosed and provided a fix for a server file
	permission issue, a common problem in local XAMPP environments that prevented
	the log file from being created.
* **Database Connection Confirmed:** The core breakthrough of the session. We
	identified and corrected invalid database credentials in `config.php`. To
	verify the fix, we created a standalone `/api/db_test.php` script which
	successfully connected to the database and fetched data.

### Current Status
The `db_test.php` script proves that the server environment, PHP configuration,
database credentials, and network connection to the database are all **correct and
functional**. However, the main application at `/api/api.php` still fails with the
same error. This definitively isolates the fault to the application's PHP code
itselfâ€”specifically, how the core files (`api.php`, `config.php`, `db.php`, and
`tasks.handler.php`) interact with each other. The only core file in this process
that we have not yet inspected is `/includes/db.php`.

### Recommended Next Steps
Our next session's goal is to resolve this final blocker and make the Tasks board
fully functional.

* **Primary Goal:** Find and fix the PHP error within the application's files.
* **The Plan:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to an issue in the database
	connection script used by the main app. We will investigate the last unseen
	file in the request lifecycle: `/includes/db.php`. It is highly likely that
	an error in its DSN (Data Source Name) string or connection options is the
	final cause of the failure.
* **The First Action:** When we resume, I will immediately ask you to provide the
	contents of `/includes/db.php` to perform a final analysis and resolve the
	issue preventing the application from loading its data.

==================================================================================
### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/8/25, 4 PM)
This session marked a critical strategic pivot from frontend UI development to the
foundational backend architecture. After finalizing the Unified Note Editor, we
prioritized building the persistence layer to make the application's data real
and durable. This involved designing and creating a new v4 database schema and
a modern, robust API gateway.

### Key Accomplishments
* Strategic Pivot to Backend: We made the key decision to pause new view
	development (like the Journal) and instead focus on building the database
	and API foundation. This "vertical slice" approach, starting with the Tasks
	board, ensures we build on a solid, data-driven core.
* v4 Database Schema Design: Learning from the v3 implementation, we designed
	and created a new, improved database schema (mydayhub_v4).
		* Centralized Preferences: Replaced the wide user_preferences table
		with a single, flexible preferences JSON column in the users table.
		* Improved Data Integrity: Established direct user_id ownership on the
		tasks table and used ENUM types for fields like status to prevent
		ambiguity.
		* Future-Proofing: Added a plan column to the users table to support
		future subscription and quota features.
		* Documentation: We updated the APP_SPEC.md to reflect the new schema
		and added a dedicated section for the database architecture.
#### "Single Pipe" API Architecture: We implemented a modern, secure API gateway.
* Gateway Created: Created a single entry point for all frontend requests
  at /api/api.php, which improves security and simplifies logic for
  cross-cutting concerns like authentication and encryption.
* Modular Handlers: Established a new /api/modules/ directory to hold
  the business logic for each data type (e.g., tasks.handler.php),
  keeping the gateway clean and the logic organized.

#### Current Status
The backend is now fully staged. The mydayhub database schema has been
created, and the API gateway at /api/api.php is in place with a functional
getAll action for tasks. The frontend (tasks.js) has not yet been updated
and is still using temporary, in-browser data.

#### Recommended Next Steps
Our next session will focus entirely on connecting the frontend to this new
backend, making the Tasks board the first fully persistent feature in v4.
* Primary Goal: Make the Tasks board load its data from the database.
* The Plan: We will perform a careful, incremental update to tasks.js,
  replacing the dev-mode functions with a fetch call to our new API. All
  existing UI logic (drag-and-drop, context menus, etc.) will be preserved.
* The First Action: When we resume, I will provide the specific, incremental
  changes needed for tasks.js to successfully call the /api/api.php
  endpoint and render the columns and tasks received from the database.

### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/8/25, 10 AM)

Our primary focus this session was to stabilize, polish, and add core
functionality to the Unified Note Editor. Through an iterative debugging and
development process, we successfully addressed multiple UI bugs and implemented the
foundational tools for the editor's format toolbar.

#### Key Accomplishments

* **Iterative UI Polishing:** We systematically fixed several visual and functional
  bugs in the editor modal, including:
  * Correcting the layout of the header, ensuring the title and control buttons
	are properly aligned.
  * Fixing the styling of the status bar for better readability and layout.
  * Implementing a functional "Maximize/Restore" feature with correct icon
	toggling.
  * Adding a monospace font to the textarea for proper character alignment.
* **Toolbar Simplification:** Per your feedback, we simplified the editor's scope
  by removing the complex responsive toolbar logic (`ResizeObserver`) and its
  associated UI elements, resulting in a cleaner and more stable component.
* **Core Toolbar Functionality:** We implemented the logic for the main format
  buttons, adapting robust patterns from the v3 code. This included:
  * **Text Transformation:** Case changing (upper, lower, title), underlining,
	and block-framing.
  * **Tools:** A functional calculator that evaluates a selected mathematical
	expression.
  * **View Controls:** Buttons to increase or decrease the font size within the
	editor's textarea.
* **Live Document Stats:** We implemented live word, character, and line counts
  that update as the user types.

#### Current Status

The Unified Note Editor is now in a stable, polished, and functional state,
meeting all current design and usability requirements.

#### Recommended Next Steps (Post-Approval)

With the editor component now complete, the next logical step is to build out
the next major, undeveloped view as defined in the application specification: the
**Journal View**.


==================================================================================
### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/8/25, 8 AM)

Our primary focus this session was a detailed, iterative design process
to replace and perfect the icons in the task card's contextual menu. We
successfully moved from emojis to a final set of custom, high-fidelity
SVG icons that are fully styled via CSS.

#### Key Accomplishments

* **Icon Design & Refinement (Iterative Process):** We went through
	several cycles to achieve the desired look and feel for the icons:
	* **Initial Upgrade:** We first replaced the original emojis with a
		set of SVG icons and implemented the best practice of using
		`currentColor` to allow for flexible CSS styling.
	* **Code Modularity:** Per your feedback, we improved the project's
		organization by moving the menu's CSS rules from the global
		`style.css` into the more specific `/assets/css/views/tasks.css`.
	* **Visual Iteration:** We refined the icon appearance over several
		steps, adjusting the `stroke-width` for clarity and changing the
		default color between blue and white to find the best look for
		the dark mode theme.
	* **Fidelity and Final Designs:** To resolve issues where some icons
		did not match your source images, I re-drew them as clean SVGs.
		For the "Change Priority" and "Move" actions, we ultimately
		opted for new, clearer designs that are more standard and
		immediately recognizable to the user.

#### Current Status

We have just completed the final iteration. I have provided you with the
updated `tasks.js` file, which contains the final SVG code for all
seven icons, and the updated `tasks.css` file, which sets their
default color to white.

The immediate next action is for you to **apply these latest changes and
confirm if the icon designs and color meet your final approval.**
(Alex said:  changes already applied and commited in GitHub)

#### Recommended Next Steps (Post-Approval)

Once you confirm the icons are perfect, we will resume our work on the
next major feature we had previously planned.

1.  **Primary Goal:** Make the Editor's Ribbon Toolbar Responsive.

2.  **The Plan:** As you noted, the editor's toolbar will not fit on mobile
	screens. We will build a system that automatically moves overflowing
	toolbar items into a "more" dropdown menu.
	* **HTML Changes (`index.php`):** Add containers for visible buttons, a
		"more" button, and a hidden dropdown.
	* **CSS Changes (`editor.css`):** Add styles to prevent wrapping and
		to style the new dropdown menu.
	* **JavaScript Logic (`editor.js`):** Use a `ResizeObserver` to
		automatically move buttons between the ribbon and the overflow menu.

3.  **The First Action:** When we resume, our first action will be to
	implement the HTML changes in `index.php`.


==================================================================================
### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/5/25, 10 PM)

Our primary goal for this session shifted from backend integration to a major
architectural enhancement: designing and building the foundational Unified Note
Editor. We successfully created this core component from the ground up, ensuring
it is modular, visually consistent with the app's theme, and functional on both
desktop and mobile.

#### Key Accomplishments
* **Architectural Pivot & Design:** We formally decided to replace the simple
	task-editing modal with a powerful, reusable Unified Note Editor for all
	parts of the application.
* **HTML Foundation:** We replaced the old modal's HTML in `index.php` with a new,
	comprehensive structure for the Unified Editor.
* **CSS Implementation:** We created and integrated a new, dedicated stylesheet at
	`/assets/css/views/editor.css`.
* **Modular JavaScript:** We created a new, self-contained JavaScript module at
	`/assets/js/editor.js` to handle the editor's core mechanics.
* **Full Integration & Testing:** We successfully connected the "Edit" button on
	task cards to our new editor by updating `tasks.js` to call
	`UnifiedEditor.open()`.
* **UI Refinement:** Based on your feedback, we adjusted the editor's default
	desktop size by modifying the CSS.

#### Current Status
The foundational Unified Note Editor is complete and functional. It opens, closes,
maximizes, and switches tabs correctly. It is successfully decoupled from the
`tasks.js` module.

#### Recommended Next Steps
Our next major task is to make the Editor's Ribbon Toolbar responsive.
1.  **Primary Goal:** Make the Editor's Ribbon Toolbar Responsive.
2.  **The Plan:** We will build a system that automatically moves overflowing
	toolbar items into a "more" dropdown menu.
	* **HTML Changes (`index.php`):** Add containers for visible buttons, a "more"
		button, and a hidden dropdown.
	* **CSS Changes (`editor.css`):** Add styles to prevent wrapping and style the
		new dropdown menu.
	* **JavaScript Logic (`editor.js`):** Use a `ResizeObserver` to automatically
		move buttons between the ribbon and the overflow menu.
3.  **The First Action:** When we resume, our first action will be to implement the
	HTML changes in `index.php`.

==================================================================================
### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/4/25, 11 PM)

Our primary goals were to polish the front-end features of the Tasks board, fix
UI bugs, and establish a clear architectural path forward.

#### Key Accomplishments
1.  **Task Card UI Refinements:**
	* **Meta Indicators Styled:** We replaced raw emojis on task cards with clean,
		styled badges using new CSS and updated JS.
	* **Contextual Menu Fixed & Refined:** We overhauled the `showQuickActionsMenu()`
		function to generate the new icon-only menu with tooltips, matching the
		spec.
2.  **"Edit Task" Modal Enhancements:**
	* **Auto-Save Implemented:** The modal now auto-saves every 60 seconds using
		`setInterval`.
	* **Live Status Update:** The modal's footer now displays a "Last saved: [time]"
		message after every save.
3.  **Backend Foundation Established:**
	* **API Endpoint Created:** We created the API endpoint file at `/api/tasks.php`
		to handle `PUT` requests for saving task data.

#### Architectural Decisions for v4
1.  **Encryption: Centralized Crypto Module:** All crypto logic will be isolated in
	`/assets/js/crypto.js` with a plaintext debugging "pass-through" mode.
2.  **Offline Functionality: Phased PWA Strategy:** We confirmed a 3-phase rollout:
	core online app first, then app shell caching, and finally full data sync
	with IndexedDB.

#### Recommended Next Steps
The next logical step is to connect the front-end save function to the back-end API.
1.  **Primary Goal:** Implement the client-side API call to save task data.
2.  **The Plan:** Modify the `saveTaskData()` function in `/assets/js/tasks.js` to
	add a `fetch()` call that sends a `PUT` request with JSON data to
	`/api/tasks.php`.

==================================================================================
### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/4/25, 12 AM)

Our primary goals were to fix the local dev environment and improve the mobile UX.

#### Key Accomplishments
* **Environment & Bug Fixes:** We fixed the local MAMP server and resolved several
	CSS bugs, including z-index and alignment issues.
* **Mobile-First Responsive UI:**
	* **Header:** Overhauled the header for mobile with a functional "hamburger" menu.
	* **Column Layout:** Implemented media queries to stack task columns vertically.
* **Core Feature Development (Tasks Board):**
	* **"Move Task" for Touch:** Implemented a mobile-friendly "Move Mode".
	* **"Edit Task" Modal:** Created a unified modal for editing notes and due dates.
	* **Task Actions Menu:** The ellipsis menu is now functional for editing,
		toggling priority, duplicating, and deleting tasks.
	* **Visual Indicators:** The system now automatically adds note and due date
		icons to task cards.

#### Recommended Next Steps
When we resume, we will focus on polishing the features we just implemented.
1.  **Style the Meta Indicators:** Add CSS rules to make the new icons look like
	clean, subtle badges.
2.  **Refine the "Edit Task" Modal:** Implement auto-save and a live "Last saved"
	status update in the footer.
3.  **Begin Backend Integration:** Create the PHP API endpoint (`/api/tasks.php`) to
	handle updating task details in the database.
