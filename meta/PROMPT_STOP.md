# Context
I need to stop for now and need your help to document how far along we are.
You will find bellow three deliverables that will be used to resume coding.
The next session may not have context of what we have been doing.
So what you will provide is critical to inform that session properly.

# Deliverables required
A) A bried note of 50 words or less to describ what we have done with the code
that will be used as a comment in the last commit to github at session end.

B) Summary of what we have done since we started this session and what would
be the recommended next steps. Since the plan is to to use this to resume 
programming in another session, please be generous in creating a good 
description that your future self can use to pickup where we left and continue
collaborating with me in this project. Use the content of SUM_PROG.md as a guide
to structure and style this summary.   Keep lines wrapping at 84 characters long 
or the nearest complete word.

B) A recommendation of APP_SPEC.md contents that may require updates or 
additions based on how we have evolved with the development of the app in
this session.  For this end you will provide a 1 by 1 guided update process
if applicable.
