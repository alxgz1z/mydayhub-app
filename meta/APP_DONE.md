# MyDayHub — Development Progress Summary
Updated: 2025-08-10
Order: chronological (newest at the bottom)

## Snapshot (current)
- Board loads via API (`getAll`).  
- Creating a task persists via `createTask`, re-sorts column, updates counter.  
- Sorting rules: incomplete first (priority before normal); completed at bottom.  
- Counters stay in sync after add and drag-and-drop.  
- Visual-only for move/priority/complete/delete/duplicate (persistence pending).

---

## 2025-08-04 00:00 — Environment & Mobile UX
**Focus**  
Stabilize local dev and improve mobile experience.

**Key work**  
- Fixed local server and CSS issues (z-index, alignment).  
- Mobile header with hamburger menu.  
- Columns stack vertically on small screens.  
- Added Move Mode (touch), unified edit modal, quick actions, and meta icons.

**Status**  
UI flows working across desktop/mobile.

**Next steps**  
- Style meta indicators as subtle badges.  
- Add editor auto-save and "Last saved" footer.  
- Create `/api/tasks.php` PUT route for saving task details.

---

## 2025-08-04 23:00 — Unified Note Editor (foundation)
**Focus**  
Replace simple modal with a reusable editor.

**Key work**  
- New HTML in `index.php` for Unified Editor shell.  
- New stylesheet `/assets/css/views/editor.css`.  
- New module `/assets/js/editor.js` (open/close, maximize, tabs).  
- Connected task Edit to `UnifiedEditor.open()`.

**Status**  
Editor foundation complete and decoupled from tasks.js.

**Next steps**  
Make the ribbon responsive (overflow-to-menu pattern).

---

## 2025-08-08 08:00 — Task Card Icons (SVG)
**Focus**  
Replace emojis with crisp SVG icons and finalize menu.

**Key work**  
- Clean SVG set styled via `currentColor`.  
- Moved menu CSS into `/assets/css/views/tasks.css`.  
- Iterated stroke-width and symbols for clarity.

**Status**  
Final icons shipped; default color tuned for theme.

**Next steps**  
Resume editor ribbon responsiveness work.

---

## 2025-08-08 10:00 — Unified Editor Polish
**Focus**  
Stabilize and add essential tools.

**Key work**  
- Fixed header layout and status bar.  
- Maximize/restore logic and icons.  
- Monospace textarea for alignment.  
- Simplified ribbon (removed ResizeObserver overflow logic).  
- Implemented case transforms, underline, block frame, calculator, font size.  
- Live word/char/line counts.

**Status**  
Editor stable and meets current usability goals.

**Next steps**  
Move on to backend integration.

---

## 2025-08-08 16:00 — Backend Architecture (pivot)
**Focus**  
Build durable persistence and a clean API.

**Key work**  
- Designed v4 schema (users with JSON preferences, columns, tasks with ENUM
  status, dense positions).  
- Created single-pipe API gateway `/api/api.php`.  
- Added `/api/modules/` for feature handlers (e.g., tasks.handler.php).  

**Status**  
DB and gateway staged; `getAll` ready.  
Frontend still using in-browser data at this point.

**Next steps**  
Wire tasks.js to the API for live board data.

---

## 2025-08-08 22:00 — Backend Debugging & Logging
**Focus**  
Unblock API JSON failures and make errors observable.

**Key work**  
- Replaced frontend dev data with `fetch` to gateway, exposing backend errors.  
- Custom error handler in `/includes/config.php` with `DEVMODE=true` writes
  to `/debug.log`.  
- Fixed server file permissions for log creation.  
- Verified DB connectivity with a standalone test script.  

**Status**  
Env and DB confirmed; remaining fault isolated to app code paths.

**Next steps**  
Inspect/repair core gateway-handler flow; proceed to data load in UI.

---

## 2025-08-10 18:00 — Tasks: Persistence + UX Stability
**Focus**  
Persist creation; stabilize sorting, counts, and effects.

**Key work**  
- Implemented `createTask` in tasks handler; returns normalized task payload.  
- Hooked "+ New Task" footer → API; render response; re-sort; update counter.  
- Fixed add-form blur/submit race (idempotent restore).  
- Moved completion handling to `change` event so sorting always runs.  
- Counters update for both source and destination after drag-and-drop.  
- Clipped completion flare to the card (`overflow:hidden`, non-interactive
  `::after`).

**Status**  
Create + load are persisted. Sorting and counters are consistent.

**Next steps**  
1) Persist `toggleComplete` and `togglePriority`.  
2) Persist `moveTask` with position compaction.  
3) Persist `deleteTask` and `duplicateTask`.  
4) Centralize fetch/error UX and consider ETag or `updated_at`.  
5) Inline title edit, keyboard flows, and helpful empty states.

---

## Testing Notes
- Verified `getAll` via curl and in UI (Weekdays/Chores sample).  
- Confirmed `createTask` persists, sorts correctly, and updates counters.  
- Counters stay accurate after drag-and-drop and after add.  
- Completion flash stays inside the task card.

---
## 2025-08-10 22:15 — Session Summary & Next Steps
**Focus**
Consolidate progress and set the next implementation path.

**Key work**
- Stabilized end-to-end flow for load, create, and cross-column move.
- Normalized client sorting triggers (render, DnD, completion change).
- Updated spec to 4.2.0 Beta; documented CSRF protection and QA criteria.
- Confirmed curl tests for createTask, moveTask, and getAll.

**Status**
Core board interactions are persisted and reliable. Remaining mutations are
documented and scheduled.

**Next steps (priority order)**

1) Status persistence
   toggleComplete(task_id, completed) and togglePriority(task_id, on);
   update status, return normalized task, and re-sort on response.
2) In-column reordering
3) Extend moveTask with to_position or before_task_id; transactional
   updates; dense positions after write.
4) Delete and duplicate
  deleteTask (remove + compact) and duplicateTask (insert at end).
5) CSRF enablement in code
   Generate token per session; emit <meta name="csrf">; validate
   X-CSRF-Token for all writes; set cookie flags (HttpOnly,
   SameSite=Lax, Secure in prod).
6) Error UX
7) Replace alerts with a small toast; standardize error envelope and logging.

## 2025-08-10 22:15 — Session Summary & Next Steps

**Session scope**

Focus: make board interactions fully persistent and smooth across desktop
and mobile. We prioritized correctness (DB writes) and UX (sorting and
mobile reachability).

**What changed in this session**

Backend (PHP)
  •	Gateway (/api/api.php)
  •	Confirms JSON for POST, validates CSRF on mutations, returns JSON with
proper status codes.
  •	Tasks module (/api/modules/tasks.handler.php)
  •	Added actions: createColumn, deleteColumn, duplicateTask,
deleteTask, reorderColumn, toggleComplete, togglePriority,
moveTask, getAll.
  •	Cross-column moves now append at destination and re-compact positions
in the source column.
  •	Same-column manual order saved via reorderColumn.
  •	Defensive ownership checks on every mutating action.
  •	Dense, zero-based positions per column are maintained.
  •	Debug logging writes to debug.log when DEVMODE=true.

Frontend (JS/CSS)
  •	tasks.js v4.5
  •	Uses X-CSRF-Token header from <meta name="csrf">.
  •	Adds persisted duplicate and delete (quick actions).
  •	Fixes race in add-task footer (blur vs submit).
  •	Re-sorts after completion/priority changes; counters refresh correctly.
  •	Drag-and-drop persists cross-column moves; manual same-column order is
queued through reorderColumn.
  •	“Move here” flow persists through API and exits move mode safely.
  •	CSS
  •	Mobile bottom safe-area spacer so column footers (“+ New Task”, move
target) are reachable on iOS Safari/Chrome.
  •	Kept flare animation scoped to the task card, not the whole column.

Data model notes
  •	tasks.status is ENUM('normal','priority','completed').
  •	columns.position and tasks.position are dense per user+column.

Security
  •	Sessions issue CSRF token; gateway requires the token for all mutations.
  •	Reads can be GET or POST JSON; mutations must be POST JSON with CSRF.

Testing performed
  •	CURL/jq sanity checks for getAll, create/move, and columns.
  •	UI tests for add, delete, duplicate, move (both methods), complete, and
priority toggles.
  •	Mobile tests on iOS Chrome and Safari for footer reachability.

Known gaps / watch-list
  •	Quick actions for priority toggle are UI-only (persisting server-side is
available; we should wire it).
  •	Completed tasks currently ignore priority toggling by design; document
clearly in spec.
  •	Column reordering (drag columns left-right) not implemented yet.
  •	No soft-delete/undo for tasks or columns.
  •	No auth; userId is stubbed to 1.

**Recommended next steps (ordered)**
  1.	Wire priority persistence: call togglePriority in tasks.js and
update the UI only on success (with optimistic UI + rollback).
  2.	Persist completion from checkbox: we already sort locally; add a
call to toggleComplete so status is saved immediately.
  3.	Column management UX: add “Rename column” and persist; add
drag-to-reorder columns and a reorderColumns endpoint.
  4.	Error handling polish: unify toast/inline errors instead of alerts;
include reason strings from backend.
  5.	Auth stub to multi-user: introduce a simple login in dev or set
userId via session to test per-user isolation.
  6.	Undo affordance: brief snackbar with “Undo” for task delete and
column delete (server-side soft delete or restore).
  7.	Spec and docs: incorporate the API/CSRF updates and mobile behavior
so new contributors can ramp quickly.

## 2025-08-15 00:00 — Inline Editing + Persistence Pass
**Focus**
Bring v3’s inline rename UX to v4 and finish persistence for priority,
complete, and task ordering while hardening move mode.

**Key work**

> Column titles are inline editable (dbl-click / double-tap).
> Task titles are inline editable with optimistic UI and rollback.
> Added API actions: renameColumn, renameTaskTitle.
> Fixed priority/complete wiring (now persisted immediately).
> Same-column reordering persists via reorderColumn.
> Cross-column moves persist and compact source positions.
> Quick action “Move” restored; move-mode footers hardened.
> Guarded inline editors against Enter+blur double commits.

**Why it matters**
Editors match v3 muscle memory on desktop and mobile, reduce friction,
and keep board state consistent across refreshes and devices.

**Implementation highlights**

> JS: dblclick handlers create a scoped input, commit on Enter/blur,
cancel on Esc; single-fire guard prevents replaceWith race.
> PHP: tasks.handler.php gained renameTaskTitle() and renameColumn();
all mutating routes retain CSRF and ownership checks.
> Business rule enforced: completed tasks cannot be re-prioritized.

**Testing performed**
> Desktop: Chrome drag/drop, rename, priority, complete, duplicate,
delete, create; refresh persistence verified.

>Mobile: iOS Safari/Chrome double-tap rename, move-mode buttons within
thumb reach; counts/sorting remain correct.

**Known gaps / watch-list**
> Column left↔right drag reordering not implemented.
> No undo UI for delete operations.
> Alerts remain; move to toasts/snackbars with reasons.
> Auth is still stubbed; multi-user not yet enabled.

**Next steps (recommended)**
1. Column reorder (drag headers left↔right) + reorderColumns API.
2. Replace alerts with non-blocking toasts and add short “Undo” for
   deletes (soft-delete or restore endpoint).
3. Unify quick actions to include “Rename” as fallback when dbl-tap is
   unavailable (accessibility).
4. Add lightweight auth in dev so userId comes from session; keep
   ownership checks intact.
5. Extend encrypted task payload to include optional notes and
   dueDate; wire Unified Editor save.
   
## 2025-08-20 22:00 — Rollback & Stabilization
   **Focus**Preserve stability by reverting failed journal scaffold and confirm tasks flow integrity.
   **Key work**
   * Discarded partial journal view scaffold after repeated 500 errors.
   * Restored last stable commit; tasks board functions as expected.
   * Verified API gateway + tasks.handler.php still stable.
   * Confirmed task create, move, sort, and counter updates persist correctly.
   * Debug logging mechanism present but debug.log pending creation.
   
   ⠀**Status**Stable baseline recovered. Tasks view persists smoothly; journal view not yet started.
   
   **Recommended next steps**
   1 Create debug.log in project root with writable permissions. (verify with test.php to create it)
   2 Reintroduce journal view incrementally with isolated code to avoid regressions.
   3 Add column reordering (drag headers ↔).
   4 Replace alerts with toast/snackbar error UX.
   5 Introduce lightweight dev auth (session userId).
