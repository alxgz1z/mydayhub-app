### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/5/25, 10 PM)

Our primary goal for this session shifted from backend integration to a major
architectural enhancement: designing and building the foundational Unified Note
Editor. We successfully created this core component from the ground up, ensuring
it is modular, visually consistent with the app's theme, and functional on both
desktop and mobile.

#### Key Accomplishments
* **Architectural Pivot & Design:** We formally decided to replace the simple
	task-editing modal with a powerful, reusable Unified Note Editor for all
	parts of the application.
* **HTML Foundation:** We replaced the old modal's HTML in `index.php` with a new,
	comprehensive structure for the Unified Editor.
* **CSS Implementation:** We created and integrated a new, dedicated stylesheet at
	`/assets/css/views/editor.css`.
* **Modular JavaScript:** We created a new, self-contained JavaScript module at
	`/assets/js/editor.js` to handle the editor's core mechanics.
* **Full Integration & Testing:** We successfully connected the "Edit" button on
	task cards to our new editor by updating `tasks.js` to call
	`UnifiedEditor.open()`.
* **UI Refinement:** Based on your feedback, we adjusted the editor's default
	desktop size by modifying the CSS.

#### Current Status
The foundational Unified Note Editor is complete and functional. It opens, closes,
maximizes, and switches tabs correctly. It is successfully decoupled from the
`tasks.js` module.

#### Recommended Next Steps
Our next major task is to make the Editor's Ribbon Toolbar responsive.
1.  **Primary Goal:** Make the Editor's Ribbon Toolbar Responsive.
2.  **The Plan:** We will build a system that automatically moves overflowing
	toolbar items into a "more" dropdown menu.
	* **HTML Changes (`index.php`):** Add containers for visible buttons, a "more"
		button, and a hidden dropdown.
	* **CSS Changes (`editor.css`):** Add styles to prevent wrapping and style the
		new dropdown menu.
	* **JavaScript Logic (`editor.js`):** Use a `ResizeObserver` to automatically
		move buttons between the ribbon and the overflow menu.
3.  **The First Action:** When we resume, our first action will be to implement the
	HTML changes in `index.php`.

### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/4/25, 11 PM)

Our primary goals were to polish the front-end features of the Tasks board, fix
UI bugs, and establish a clear architectural path forward.

#### Key Accomplishments
1.  **Task Card UI Refinements:**
	* **Meta Indicators Styled:** We replaced raw emojis on task cards with clean,
		styled badges using new CSS and updated JS.
	* **Contextual Menu Fixed & Refined:** We overhauled the `showQuickActionsMenu()`
		function to generate the new icon-only menu with tooltips, matching the
		spec.
2.  **"Edit Task" Modal Enhancements:**
	* **Auto-Save Implemented:** The modal now auto-saves every 60 seconds using
		`setInterval`.
	* **Live Status Update:** The modal's footer now displays a "Last saved: [time]"
		message after every save.
3.  **Backend Foundation Established:**
	* **API Endpoint Created:** We created the API endpoint file at `/api/tasks.php`
		to handle `PUT` requests for saving task data.

#### Architectural Decisions for v4
1.  **Encryption: Centralized Crypto Module:** All crypto logic will be isolated in
	`/assets/js/crypto.js` with a plaintext debugging "pass-through" mode.
2.  **Offline Functionality: Phased PWA Strategy:** We confirmed a 3-phase rollout:
	core online app first, then app shell caching, and finally full data sync
	with IndexedDB.

#### Recommended Next Steps
The next logical step is to connect the front-end save function to the back-end API.
1.  **Primary Goal:** Implement the client-side API call to save task data.
2.  **The Plan:** Modify the `saveTaskData()` function in `/assets/js/tasks.js` to
	add a `fetch()` call that sends a `PUT` request with JSON data to
	`/api/tasks.php`.

### Session Summary & Next Steps (8/4/25, 12 AM)

Our primary goals were to fix the local dev environment and improve the mobile UX.

#### Key Accomplishments
* **Environment & Bug Fixes:** We fixed the local MAMP server and resolved several
	CSS bugs, including z-index and alignment issues.
* **Mobile-First Responsive UI:**
	* **Header:** Overhauled the header for mobile with a functional "hamburger" menu.
	* **Column Layout:** Implemented media queries to stack task columns vertically.
* **Core Feature Development (Tasks Board):**
	* **"Move Task" for Touch:** Implemented a mobile-friendly "Move Mode".
	* **"Edit Task" Modal:** Created a unified modal for editing notes and due dates.
	* **Task Actions Menu:** The ellipsis menu is now functional for editing,
		toggling priority, duplicating, and deleting tasks.
	* **Visual Indicators:** The system now automatically adds note and due date
		icons to task cards.

#### Recommended Next Steps
When we resume, we will focus on polishing the features we just implemented.
1.  **Style the Meta Indicators:** Add CSS rules to make the new icons look like
	clean, subtle badges.
2.  **Refine the "Edit Task" Modal:** Implement auto-save and a live "Last saved"
	status update in the footer.
3.  **Begin Backend Integration:** Create the PHP API endpoint (`/api/tasks.php`) to
	handle updating task details in the database.
