### 2025-10-14 — View Initialization, Lazy Loading, Footer & Header
- Only the active view initializes (Tasks/Journal lazy-loaded) via `view-manager.js`.
- Exposed `window.initTasksView` and `window.initJournalView`; removed eager auto-inits.
- Unified the footer “View Options” slider icon and ensured true visual centering.
- Header background set to neutral black for accent-agnostic aesthetics.
- Tasks board sizing improved on wide screens; equalized heights + in-column scrolling; preserved natural growth on mobile.
- Unified hover effects for task cards and journal entries.
- Journal: persisted weekend toggle; corrected focal date centering when skipping weekends.

### 2025-10-15 — Accent Color, Contrast, Login & Preferences Hardening
- Added Accent Color customization (modal, presets, custom, reset-to-default).
- Persisted accent in localStorage and `users.preferences`; safe server fallbacks.
- Forced dynamic CSS variables with `!important`; reapplied on theme change (light/high-contrast).
- Login pages now adopt accent from localStorage (no auth dependency).
- Fixed Mission Focus Chart source and GET param pass-through in API gateway; robust JSON/error handling.
- Auto-contrast for toast text; active settings buttons compute readable text color; removed hardcoded greens across CSS/JS.
- Repaired view init sequencing so Mission Focus renders even when only one view is loaded.
- Known follow-up: Journal tab inactive/hover contrast to polish (tracked as pending).

### 2025-10-16 — Privacy Security, Journal CRUD Fixes & UX Polish (v8.3)

- **Classification Duplication**: Fixed journal entry duplication to properly copy classification field
- **Title Persistence**: Journal entry title edits now save properly on blur (previously lost on refresh)
- **Cross-hatch Pattern**: Private tasks now use elegant cross-hatch background pattern matching journal entries
- **Delete Fix**: Journal entry deletion now works (API method mismatch resolved - POST now accepted)
- **Backend Security**: Added server-side validation preventing private item duplication (403 responses)
- **Journal Menu Reorganization**: "Show Weekends" moved to top, added "Jump to Today" with clock icon
- **Navigation Enhancement**: Quick return to today's date via new menu option
- **Favicon Update**: Changed site favicon and app icons to `leaf.svg` for brand consistency
