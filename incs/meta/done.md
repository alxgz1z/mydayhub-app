### 2025-01-07 ‚Äî Zero-Knowledge Encryption Implementation & Critical Bug Discovery
**Focus**: Zero-knowledge encryption system implementation and critical encryption bug identification

**Zero-Knowledge Encryption System Implemented**:
- **Database Schema**: Created `user_encryption_keys`, `item_encryption_keys`, `user_security_questions`, `encryption_migration_status`, `encryption_audit_log` tables
- **Core Encryption Module**: `/incs/crypto.php` - Centralized encryption engine with Argon2id key derivation, AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Client-Side Crypto**: `/uix/crypto.js` - Web Crypto API integration (moved from Web Workers due to crypto.subtle unavailability)
- **Setup Wizard**: Multi-step encryption setup with security questions and password setup
- **API Integration**: Updated `/api/tasks.php` to encrypt/decrypt private tasks automatically
- **Column Privacy Inheritance**: When column made private, all tasks inherit privacy and get encrypted
- **Shared Task Conflict Resolution**: Auto-unsharing of shared tasks when making columns private
- **Recovery System**: Security questions-based recovery envelope for master key backup

**Critical Bug Discovery**:
- **Issue**: Encryption envelope structure is created correctly but actual data content is stored in plaintext
- **Evidence**: Database shows `encrypted_data` with proper JSON envelope (`encrypted: true`, `item_type`, `item_id`, `encrypted_at`) but `data` field contains readable plaintext
- **Example**: Task ID 70 marked private shows `"title": "This should not be readable"` in plaintext within the envelope
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Suspected that `encryptTaskData()` function creates envelope but doesn't actually encrypt the `data` field content

**UI Fixes**:
- **Confirmation Dialog Bug**: Fixed `ReferenceError: showConfirmDialog is not defined` by replacing with `showConfirm()`
- **Global Function Exposure**: Added `window.showConfirm = showConfirm` to make function available across modules
- **Async Function Structure**: Cleaned up `showSharedTaskConfirmation()` to use proper async/await pattern

**Files Modified**: 
- **New Files**: `sql/zero_knowledge_encryption_schema.sql`, `/incs/crypto.php`, `/uix/crypto.js`, `/uix/encryption-setup.js`, `api/secquestions.php`, `api/encryption.php`
- **Updated**: `api/tasks.php`, `api/api.php`, `index.php`, `uix/style.css`, `uix/tasks.js`, `uix/calendar.js`, `uix/app.js`

**Next Steps Required**:
1. **Investigate `/incs/crypto.php`**: Examine `encryptTaskData()` and `decryptTaskData()` functions to identify why data content isn't being encrypted
2. **Test Encryption Functions**: Create test script to verify encryption/decryption is working at the function level
3. **Debug Database Updates**: Verify that encrypted data is being properly saved to database
4. **Validate Key Management**: Ensure user encryption keys are properly generated and accessible
5. **Fix Encryption Logic**: Implement proper data encryption within the envelope structure
6. **Test End-to-End**: Verify private tasks are truly encrypted and unreadable in database

**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Zero-knowledge encryption not functioning despite complete infrastructure implementation
