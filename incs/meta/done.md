## Session History

### 2025-10-04 — UI/UX refinements
- Theme polishing (light/dark), improved cards, modals, icons; completion sound toggle
- Renamed auth routes; favicon/app icons updated

### 2025-10-05 — Calendar Overlays
- Events/Preferences/Management tabs; header badge; JSON import/export; CRUD + priorities
- Added schemas and endpoints for events and calendar preferences

### 2025-10-06 — Mission Focus & Network Access
- Replaced SVG rings with Chart.js; dynamic counts; real-time updates; perf guards
- Smart URL detection, DHCP-safe hostnames; console cleanup

### 2025-10-07 — ZK Encryption baseline; CRITICAL bug logged
- Added encryption schemas and modules; setup wizard and recovery via security questions
- Integrated client crypto; column privacy inheritance; auto-unshare on private column
- Found bug: envelope created but payload remains plaintext; fix required in encrypt/decrypt

### 2025-10-08 — ZK Encryption COMPLETE; Hybrid Architecture Implemented
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Data content now properly encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Hybrid Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Server decrypts for display, maintains encrypted storage
- **Security Questions Recovery**: Password recovery without compromising zero-knowledge principle
- **Optional Encryption Setup**: Moved from mandatory login to user-triggered via privacy actions
- **Column Privacy Inheritance**: Making columns private automatically encrypts all tasks
- **Task Board Loading Fixed**: Resolved async function issues preventing board rendering
- **Debug Information**: Added task_id and column_id display in DEV_MODE
- **SSL Security**: Moved certificates to environment variables, removed from repository
- **Database Migration**: Updated hosted mirror with safe migration scripts
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Proactive validation, confirmation dialogs, toast notifications
- **Architecture Decision**: Hybrid approach balances security with usability
- **VALIDATION COMPLETE**: Task 39 successfully encrypted → public → decrypted workflow confirmed

### 2025-10-08 — Journal View Implementation & UI Fixes
- **Journal View Core**: Implemented horizontal date-based columns with CRUD operations
- **Database Schema**: Created journal_entries, journal_task_links, journal_preferences tables
- **Backend API**: Full journal module with encryption/decryption integration
- **Frontend UI**: Journal view with date navigation, entry creation, editing, deletion
- **View Switching**: Implemented tab navigation between Tasks and Journal views
- **CSS Architecture**: Used visibility/opacity approach to avoid display property conflicts
- **Task Layout Preservation**: Fixed regression where tasks view reverted to stacked layout
- **Smart Menu Positioning**: Contextual menus now auto-adjust to prevent viewport overflow
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive journal columns, collapsible tab navigation
- **Integration**: Journal entries support same privacy/encryption system as tasks
- **Code Separation**: Maintained clean separation between tasks and journal modules
- **VALIDATION COMPLETE**: Journal view loads correctly, view switching works, menu positioning fixed

### 2025-10-08 — User Guide & Documentation
- **User Guide Created**: Comprehensive `/incs/userguide.php` with accordion sections
- **Content Sections**: 10 major topics covering getting started, classification philosophy, tasks, privacy/encryption, sharing, journal, advanced features, settings, shortcuts, and troubleshooting
- **Visual Design**: Theme-aware styling, SVG icons, classification badges, tip/warning boxes
- **Accordion UI**: One-section-at-a-time expansion for focused reading
- **Settings Integration**: Added "User Guide" button as last option in settings panel
- **Tab Icon Update**: Replaced emoji icons with SVG icons for Tasks and Journal tabs
