You are tasked with generating clear and actionable documentation to record the current state of development at the end of this coding session. Future sessions may begin without recent context, so your output must enable seamless project resumption.

# Deliverables
1 Commit Note

2 Development Summary & Next Steps
	* Summarize work completed during this session.
	* List recommended next steps for development continuation.
	* Structure and style the summary using the guidelines and formatting conventions in APP_DONE.md.
3 Specification Review
	* Identify specific sections in APP_SPEC.md that may require updates or additions based on today’s progress.
	* If changes are needed, provide a point-by-point update guide following the format and style found in APP_SPEC.md.

# Instructions
* Use markdown lists, clear headings, and bold for key actions.
* Be generous in context to empower effective session pickup.
