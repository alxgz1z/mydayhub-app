MyDayHub â€” Logo Design Brief
=============================

App Description for Graphic Designer:

MyDayHub is a privacy-first productivity hub that helps teams distinguish between "signal" work (mission-advancing) and "noise" work (merely busy). 

Core Identity:
- **Signal over Noise**: Classification-driven focus on what truly matters
- **Privacy by Design**: Zero-knowledge encryption with Costa Rican beach-inspired version names (Herradura, Tamarindo)
- **Fluid & Minimalist**: Dark-first aesthetic, clean lines, optimistic interactions
- **Dual Nature**: Combines task management (Kanban boards) with journaling (date-based reflection)
- **Focus Metrics**: Visual chart showing signal/support/backlog distribution

Visual Themes:
- Modern, minimal, sophisticated
- Green accent (#22c55e) - Costa Rica nature inspiration
- Balance between structure (task boards) and flow (journal entries)
- Privacy/security without feeling locked down
- Accessibility-forward design

Suggested Visual Elements:
- Leaf motif (current logo - natural growth, Costa Rica connection)
- Signal waves or concentric circles (focus, clarity)
- Balanced geometric forms suggesting organization and mindfulness
- Optional: Subtle encryption/security element

Avoid: Corporate tech, overwhelming complexity, cold/clinical aesthetics
